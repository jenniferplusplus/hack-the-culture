    <p>This project was built by Juanita, Jennifer, and Jordan from Women Who Code DFW to participate in the Hack the
       Culture hackathon. This is a simple proof of concept.</p>
    <p>We do not have information for most jurisdictions. We looked up some court rulings, public health orders, and
       executive orders for texas and a few of its counties. If this project were to be developed further, this kind of
       research would need to be extended to the whole country. Possibly some news or advocacy groups have done a lot of
       this work already, and we might be able to access it.</p>
    <h2>Future Development</h2>
    <v-list>
      <v-list-item>
        <li>Connect people with local resources in their area. This would again represent a significant
            research project.
        </li>
      </v-list-item>
      <v-list-item>
        <li>Collect email addresses and send updates when there are new developments.</li>
      </v-list-item>
      <v-list-item>
        <li>Connect tenants with each other to help them organize so they can engage in collective negotiation and
            actions. This would need to be done carefully to protect their safety and privacy.
